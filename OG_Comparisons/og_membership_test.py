Title: og_membership_test.py
Date: 2022-03-08
Author: Vir√°g Varga

Description:
	This program compares the parsed results files from Broccoli, OrthoFinder,
		ProteinOrtho and SonicParanoid, in order the score the similarity of the
		orthologous clusters created by these programs.
	The user can set a target threshold average similarity value, under which results
		should not be reported. Default is 50%.

List of functions:
	data_2_pandas(broccoli_db, orthofinder_db, proteinortho_db, sonicparanoid_db):
		Loads input parsed OG databases into Pandas dataframes and dictionaries. 
	create_prot_dict(broccoli_df, orthofinder_df, proteinortho_df, sonicparanoid_df):
		Creates the protein query ID to list of assigned OGs dictionary.
	filter_prot_dict(broccoli_df, orthofinder_df, proteinortho_df, sonicparanoid_df):
		Filter the contents of the protein query ID to list of assigned OGs
		dictinary to only include those OGs as keys that were clustered by more than 1
		clustering program.
	membership_test()
	avg_membership_scores()
	threshold_test()

List of standard and non-standard modules used:
	sys
	pandas
	json
	difflib
	statistics

Procedure:
	1. Loading required modules, setting the threshold value to be used in the
		comparison filtration and the corresponding output file name.
	2. Determining input files as command-line arguments, and importing the contents
		of these databases into Pandas dataframes and dictionaries. Dictionaries
		are exported in JSON format. Checkpoint 1 is reached at the completion of
		this step.
	3. Creation of the protein query ID to OG cluster assignments list dictionary.
		Checkpoint 2 is reached at the conclusion of this step, when this dictionary
		is exported in JSON format.
	4. Filtration of the protein query ID to OG assignment list dictionary to exclude
		protein queries that were only clustered by one program. Checkpoint 3 is reached
		at the conclusion of this step, when the new dictionary is exported in JSON
		format.
	5. The all-vs-all OG membership tests are completed, and a dictionary is created
		containing the similarity scores of the clusters created by the programs.
		Checkpoint 4 is reached at the conclusion of this step, when this comparison
		dictionary is exported in JSON format.
	6. The scores inside of the comparison dictionary are averaged. Checkpoint 4.5 is
		reached at the conclusion of this step, when this smaller dictionary is exported
		in JSON format.
	7. The threshold membership percentage value is used to filter the programs with
		the most similar clusters, and a new dictionary is created to containing only
		this data. Checkpoint 5 is reached at the conclusion of this step.
	8. The contents ot the dictionary created in the final step (ie. the final,
		membership threshold-filtered data) is written out to a text file.

Known bugs and limitations:
	- There is no quality-checking integrated into the code.
	- The names of the JSON files created at the checkpoints are not user-defined. This
		means that running the program multiple times in the same directory will
		overwrite existing files from a previous run.
	- The final results file is similarly pre-determined, though the threshold percentage
		value is integrated into the file name, so the program will not overwrite the
		results file if a different threshold value is used.
	- The membership_percent threshold value must be given as an integer, not as a
		decimal percentage.
	- This program is intended for use with parsed Broccoli results from which duplicates have 
		already been removed. 

Usage:
	The full program can be run with:
		./og_membership_test.py broccoli_db orthofinder_db proteinortho_db sonicparanoid_db [membership_percent]
		OR
		python og_membership_test.py broccoli_db orthofinder_db proteinortho_db sonicparanoid_db [membership_percent]

		* Where the membership_percent threshold value should be given as an integer percentage value.

	Alternatively, the program can be run from a checkpoint, using a JSON file produced
		during the earlier stages of the analysis. In such a case, the program should
		be run like so:
			./og_membership_test.py [JSON_file] [membership_percent]
			OR
			python og_membership_test.py [JSON_file] [membership_percent]

		* Where the acceptable input JSON files include:
			- prot_dict.json: This will start the program after Checkpoint 2, by providing a
				complete version of the prot_dict protein query to OG list dictionary.
			- filt_prot_dict.json: This will start the program after Checkpoint 3, by providing
				a complete version of the filt_prot_dict filtered protein query to OG list,
				from which queries only predicted to cluster by one program have been removed.
			- compare_OG_dict.json: This will start the program after Checkpoint 4, by
				providing a version of the compare_dict clustering program to cluster score list
				dictionary.
			- og_score_dict.json: This will start the program after Checkpoint 4.5, by providing
				a version of the OG scoring dictionary in which the average scores have already
				been calculated.
		* Note! The membership testing, which occurs after Checkpoint 3, requires the input of
			dictionaries created from the orthologous clustering dataframes. These are produced
			during the Pandas dataframe imports, and are printed out to JSON files. While they should
			not be added as command-line arguments, they should be in the directory from which this
			program is run.

This script was written for Python 3.8.12, in Spyder 5.1.5.

	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14720324/compute-the-similarity-between-two-lists
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity

	Both of these methods yeild similar results, within 0.02 (compared two lists with different similarities).
	I chose to use difflib because of its far simpler implementation.

	'''
	A note on the scoring mechanism used above:

	The way the scoring is done, if clusters are particularly similar between two programs, with the same
	proteins appearing in the OGs of both, the OG's will in some sense be scored multiple times.

	I justify the choice to allow this because giving more weight to programs that are providing more
	similar clusters is useful when trying to quantify the quality of the orthologous clusters these
	programs produce. A cluster that is identified by multiple programs is more likely to be reliable; and
	programs that are identifying similar clusters are likely more adept at identifying OGs within
	these particularly divergent, unique organisms.
