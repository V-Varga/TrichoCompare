Title: og_stats__v2.py
Date: 2022-03-15
Author: Vir√°g Varga

Description:
	This program performs basic statistical tests on the parsed results of orthologous
		clustering software (OrthoFinder, SonicParanoid, ProteinOrtho, Broccoli).

List of functions:
	No functions are used in this script.

List of standard and non-standard modules used:
	argparse
	pandas
	os
	statistics
	numpy
	matplotlib.pyplot
	check_og_duplicates.py

Procedure:
	1. Assignment of command-line arguments with argparse.
	2. Importing modules and parsing arguments. Running code specific to individual
		arguments.
			If -dupl argument is used, check_og_duplicates.py module will be called
			and run immediately.
	3. Main program code:
		- If necessary, removing species column from dataframe
		- Importing OG data into dictionary with format ortho_dict[OG_ID] = list_of_queries
		- Creating additional dictionary with format og_size_dict[OG_ID] = number_of_queries
		- Identifying number of OGs created by program
		- Identifying largest and smallest OGs (initially search for 10)
		- Identifying OGs with only 1 protein
		- Creating histogram showing distribustion of OG sizes
	4. Writing out results to text file.

Known bugs and limitations:
	- IMPORTANT: The location of the check_og_duplicates.py module is HARDCODED into 
		this script! If the files structure of the user is different, then they will 
		need to alter that portion of the -dupl argument parsing script.
	- There is no quality-checking integrated into the code.
	- The name of the output file is not user-defined.
	- The input file used for the program must be an un-pivoted results file of either
		Broccoli, OrthoFinder, SonicParanoid, or ProteinOrtho, following the structure
		used by the parsers used previously in this workflow.
	- The program cannot accept multiple input files, nor can it determine the type
		of input file it was given (ie. which program's results file was used as input).

Version: 
	This is version 2.0 of the program. The following changes were make to the script, 
		to increase ease of program use: 
		- The output file names were made reliant on input file names - this allows 
			the script to be run in the same directory on different parsed OG files 
			orginating from the same program, without overwriting results or requiring
			the names of results files to be manually altered. 
		- Made the script more flexible re: number of columns. Now filtered parsed data
			can still be processed, even if the formatting does not match the original
			parsed OG data file. 
		- Functionality was added to print a histogram of OG sizes to an image file. 

Usage:
	./og_stats__v2.py [-h] [-br] [-of] [-po] [-sp] [-dupl] [-v] INPUT_FILE
	OR
	python og_stats__v2.py [-h] [-br] [-of] [-po] [-sp] [-dupl] [-v] INPUT_FILE

This script was written for Python 3.8.12, in Spyder 5.1.5.
