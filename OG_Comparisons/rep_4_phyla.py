Author: Vir√°g Varga

Description:
	This program performs filters the parsed results of orthologous clustering software
		(OrthoFinder, SonicParanoid, ProteinOrtho, Broccoli) in order to identify OGs
		that are present in either the 4 main phyla, or the 4 main phyla and more basal
		species.
		An optional argument allows the isolation of OGs that are found in all 4 phyla
			and the basal species (Barthelona).

List of functions:
	No functions are used in this script.

List of standard and non-standard modules used:
	sys
	pandas
	os

Procedure:
	1. Importing necessary modules, assigning command-line arguments.
	2. Importing data into Pandas dataframes.
	3. Setting up data types (dataframe for ref file, dictionary for infile) that will be used.
	4. Creating dictionary of phyla represented in each OG.
	5. Identifying OGs that include representatives of all 4 phyla.
	6. Copying threshold-meeting OG information into a new dataframe & writing out.
	7. (Optional) Writing out only those OGs that include the 4 main phyla and Barthelona
		This step can be called with the use of the string "other" as the 4th command-line argument.

Known bugs and limitations:
	- There is no quality-checking integrated into the code.
	- The name of the output file(s) is/are not user-defined.
	- The input file used for the program must be an un-pivoted results file of either
		Broccoli, OrthoFinder, SonicParanoid, or ProteinOrtho, following the structure
		used by the parsers used previously in this workflow.
	- The program cannot accept multiple input parsed OG files simultaneously.
	- In order to activate the optional argument to output OGs including the 4 main phyla
		and Barthelona, the user must provide the string "other" as the 4th command-line argument.

Usage:
	./rep_4_phyla.py input_db ref_db ["other"]
	OR
	python rep_4_phyla.py input_db ref_db ["other"]

This script was written for Python 3.8.12, in Spyder 5.1.5.

#Part 1: Import necessary modules, assign command-line arguments

#import necessary modules

import pandas as pd #allows manipulation of dataframes in Python
import os #allow access to computer files

infile = sys.argv[1]

#Part 2: Import data into Pandas dataframes

#import input file into pandas dataframe

#remove 3rd column from Pandas dataframe if necessary
#needed for original parsed results of OrthoFinder, ProteinOrtho & SonicParanoid

#Part 3: Set up data types (dataframe for ref file, dictionary for infile) that will be used

#identify OG column name (for use later)
