Title: link_data_files.py
Date: 2022-03-07
Author: VirÃ¡g Varga

Description:
	This program creates symbolic links (symlinks) between parsed data files stored
		in a per-analysis program structure, to to directories specific to the
		strain or species being analyzed.
	This linking is necessary as preparation for the construction of species-specific
		databases with annotations on each protein query.

List of functions:
	No functions are defined in this script.

List of standard and non-standard modules used:
	sys
	os
	subprocess

Procedure:
	1. Loading required modules; defining inputs as command line
		arguments; loading the contents of the reference file as a list.
	2. Matching the substrings contained in the reference file to the subdirectory
		and results file names. When matches are found, creating a symlink from 
		the source file to the destination directory. 

Known bugs and limitations:
	- There is no quality-checking integrated into the code.
	- This program requires the following formatting for inputs: 
		-> Source and distination directories must be given without a trailing 
			forwardslash ("/") at the end of the path. The full path must be given 
			as the argument, relative paths will not work. 
		-> The input reference file must contain substrings to search for in file
			and directory names in the format of one substring per line. 

Usage
	./link_data_files.py parsed_data_dir species_file species_dir
	OR
	python link_data_files.py parsed_data_dir species_file species_dir

This script was written for Python 3.8.12, in Spyder 5.1.5.
