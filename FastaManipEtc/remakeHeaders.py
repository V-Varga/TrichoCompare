Title: remakeHeaders.py
Date: 2022-02-08
Author: VirÃ¡g Varga

Description:
	This program replaces the original FASTA headers with the random alphanumeric
		headers assigned by the assignFASTAheaders.py program, using the
		reference file created by the other program as a guide.
	This program was created as a result of the accidental deletion of a number of
		the encoded FASTA files, in order to recreate them.

List of functions:
	No functions are defined in this script.

List of standard and non-standard modules used:
	sys
	re
	pandas

Procedure:
	1. Loading required modules & assigning command line arguments.
	2. Using Pandas to load the contents of the reference file into a dictionary.
	3. Parsing the input FASTA file in order to match the random headers to the
		original headers via the reference file.
	4. Writing out the new FASTA file with the original FASTA headers.

Known bugs and limitations:
	- There is no quality-checking integrated into the code.
	- The user needs to check that the correct reference file is assigned.

Usage
	./remakeHeaders.py input_fasta ref_doc
	OR
	python remakeHeaders.py input_fasta ref_doc

This script was written for Python 3.8.12, in Spyder 5.1.5.
