Title: replace_AA.py
Date: 21.12.2021
Author: VirÃ¡g Varga

Description:
	This program replaces a selected non-standard amino acid in a protein FASTA
		with a chosen replacement.
	It is intended for use in instances of uncertain amino acids (ex.: "B", "Z",
		or "J"). In these instances, the user can replace the uncertain amino acid
		with their choice of replacement. If no replacement is given, the uncertain
		amino acid is simply removed.

List of functions:
	No functions are defined in this script.

List of standard and non-standard modules used:
	sys

Procedure:
	1. Loading required modules & assigning command line argument.
	2. Parsing the input FASTA file in order to replace selected non-standard
		amino acid in the sequences with chosen replacement.
	3. Writing out the new FASTA file with standardized amino acids.


Known bugs and limitations:
	- There is no quality-checking integrated into the code.
	- The name of the output file is pre-determined (not user-defined), based on
		the name of the input FASTA file.

Usage
	./replace_AA.py input_fasta nonStandard_aa replacement_aa
	OR
	python replace_AA.py input_fasta nonStandard_aa replacement_aa

This script was written for Python 3.8.12, in Spyder 5.1.5.
