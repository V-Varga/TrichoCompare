Title: assignFASTAheaders_v2.py
Date: 28.11.2021
Author: VirÃ¡g Varga

Description:
	This program replaces FASTA headers in a FASTA file with a 16-character random
		alphanumeric code. A reference file is also printed that links the
		random code to the original FASTA header. A larger reference file is used
		as input and then appended to in order to ensure that no alphanumeric header
		is repeated.

List of functions:
	No functions are defined in this script.

List of standard and non-standard modules used:
	sys
	re
	random
	string
	pandas

Procedure:
	1. Loading required modules & assigning command line argument.
    2. Contents of the large reference database are loaded into a Pandas dataframe,
		and existing alphanumeric headers are extracted to ensure no repitition.
	3. Parsing the input FASTA file in order to extract headers and generate
		random alphanumeric codes to replace them.
	4. Writing out the new FASTA file with the alphanumeric code headers,
		accompanied by the reference file.


Known bugs and limitations:
	- There is no quality-checking integrated into the code.

Version: 2.0
	The previous version of this script (assignFASTAheaders.py) did not include any
		mechanism for ensuring that the alphanumeric headers were not repeated.

Usage
	./assignFASTAheaders.py input_fasta ref_file
	OR
	python assignFASTAheaders.py input_fasta ref_file

This script was written for Python 3.8.12, in Spyder 5.1.5.
